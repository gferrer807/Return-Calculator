Simple return calculator. I hope to implement this via a web application

Some fixes that need to be addressed
-Currently no way to deny weekly amount without program exiting
-Would like to add a randomization factor. Daily percentages are never static
-Less verbose. Going past 80 chars on 1 line is too much
-more tbd...

Hope whoever uses this likes it :)
